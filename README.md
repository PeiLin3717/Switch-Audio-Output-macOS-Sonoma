# Purpose
Switch audio output using Applescript automatically to HomePod or back to built-in speakers on macOS Sonoma

# Use
Download the applescipt, run it on Automator to swtich audio output source.

In this script, the output source are switched between the first output source and the second. Normally the fist one is the built-in speakers, the second one depends. If the second output source is not what you needed, revise the row number ("row 2" in the script) in line 48 and line 84 to the row you find in the output table in Sound in System Settings.

You can use Karabiner or other Key remapping apps to asign a shortcut to this script it.
