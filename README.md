# Purpose
Switch audio output using Applescript automatically to HomePod or back to built-in speakers on macOS Sonoma

# Use
Download the applescipt, run it on Automator to swtich audio output source.

In this script, the output source is switched between the first output source and the second. Normally the fist output is the built-in speakers, and the second one depends. If the second output source is not what you need, revise the row number ("row 2" in the script) in line 48 and line 84 to the row you want in the output table in Sound in the System Settings app.

You can use Karabiner or other Key remapping apps to asign a shortcut to this script.
